    Muhammad Kutty Panaparambil Ismail (born 7 September 1951), known mononymously by the hypocorism Mammootty
    ([mɐmːuːʈːi]), is an Indian actor and film producer who works predominantly in Malayalam-language films. He has also
    appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, and English-language productions. In a career spanning five decades, he
    has appeared in more than 420 films, predominantly in lead roles. He is the recipient of several accolades,
    including three National Film Awards, eleven Kerala State Film Awards, eleven Kerala Film Critics Awards and fifteen
    Filmfare Awards South. He was honored with the Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian award by the Government of
    India in 1998, for his contributions to cinema. He was also honored with the Kerala Prabha Award by the Government
    of Kerala in 2022.

    Mammootty made his debut in acting through Malayalam film Anubhavangal Paalichakal in 1971. His first leading role
    was in M. T. Vasudevan Nair's unreleased film Devalokam (1979). Mammootty's breakthrough came in 1981 when he
    received the Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor for his performance in Ahimsa. Major commercial successes
    during this time included the 1983 films Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu and Aa Raathri. Following a series of box office
    failures, the 1987 crime thriller New Delhi improved his commercial prospects. The films that followed through the
    next decade established Mammootty as one of the leading stars of Malayalam cinema.
